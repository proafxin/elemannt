	\chapter{Two Elementary Proofs of the Prime Number Theorem}\label{ch:pnt}
	The two proofs in this chapter essentially use the same ideas. There is a lot of history until this point in mathematics. We will cover some of it in \autoref{ch:dispute}. For now, we will ignore the history and focus only on the proof.
